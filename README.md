# Java-Doubly-Linked-List-
A doubly linked list with a set of functions and visualization in swing

## Actions: <br>
Initializing the list<br>
Adding an item to the top of the list<br>
Adding an item to the end of the list<br>
Showing all list items<br>
Deleting all list items<br>
Determining the number of list items<br>
Checking the list for emptiness<br>
Deleting the first element<br>
Deleting the last element<br>
Search for this value in the list<br>
Search for the largest and smallest values in the list<br>
Deleting a list item with this value<br>
Deleting all list items with this value<br>
Changing all list items with the given value to a new one.<br>
Determining whether the list is symmetric.<br>
Determining whether it is possible to remove any two elements from the list so<br>
that the new list is ordered.<br>
Determining how many different values are contained in the list.<br>
Deleting elements from the list whose values have already been found in<br>
previous elements.<br>
Changing the order of the elements to reverse.<br>
Sorting list items in two ways (changing pointers, 
changing the values of elements)<br>
An ordered list of books is given. Add a new book while maintaining
the order of the list.<br>
Two ascending lists are given. Combine them into a new
ascending list.<br>
A list of integers is given. Arrange in ascending order only:
a) positive numbers; b) elements with even ordinal numbers in 
the list.<br>
Two lists are given. Determine whether the sets of their elements coincide.<br>
A list is given. After each element, add the preceding part 
the list.<br>
