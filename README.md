Initializing the list
Adding an item to the top of the list
Adding an item to the end of the list
Showing all list items
Deleting all list items
Determining the number of list items

Deleting all list items with this value
Changing all list items with the given value to a new one.
Determining whether the list is symmetric.
Determining whether it is possible to remove any two elements from the list so
that the new list is ordered.
Determining how many different values are contained in the list.
Deleting elements from the list whose values have already been found in
previous elements.
Changing the order of the elements to reverse.
Sorting list items in two ways (changing pointers, 
changing the values of elements)
An ordered list of books is given. Add a new book while maintaining
the order of the list.
Two ascending lists are given. Combine them into a new
ascending list.
A list of integers is given. Arrange in ascending order only:
